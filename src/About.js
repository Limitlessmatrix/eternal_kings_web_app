            <p>We started enternal kings in the New World Beta. We never thought we would grow to such great lengths. 
                We had about 5 members from another MMO. Then we grew in the Arali server and moved to El Dorado during the second Beta.
                We have several people that have developed our group. From professional streamers to amature gamers. We welcome all types of gamers.
